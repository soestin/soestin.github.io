#### The Humble Beginnings

**Q: Charlie, can you tell us about your life before finding the golden ticket?**

#### Inside the Chocolate Factory

**Charlie Bucket**: I want to continue Mr. Wonka's factory of magic and chocolate. But I also want to make sure the factory is a place where everyone feels welcome. My family will be moving in with me; Together we will be making the factory a place for everyone.

#### Final Thoughts
